# Sermons Feature Delivery – End-to-End Summary

This document chronicles every sermons-related change completed during the implementation effort, spanning Flutter, backend alignment, and supporting infrastructure. Use it as the authoritative reference when auditing scope, onboarding teammates, or planning follow-up work.

---

## 1. Executive snapshot
- **Surface delivered:** A production-ready sermons experience inside the Flutter app, including list browsing, filtering, detail presentation, and a dedicated favorites view.
- **State management:** Centralized in `SermonsProvider`, registered in `main.dart` and shared across list/detail/favorites flows.
- **Data integrity:** Flutter models mirror the backend `SermonOut` contract, derive resilient thumbnails, and keep published-only semantics enforced client-side and server-side.
- **UI polish:** Cards render consistent metadata, detail sheets size to content, and ministry tags appear only where contextually helpful.
- **Backend handshake:** Listing endpoints now guarantee newest-first ordering; client filters always send `published=true` to avoid draft exposure.

---

## 2. Data layer highlights
- Implemented `lib/models/sermon.dart` with parity to backend fields (`id`, localized text variants, ministry list, roles, timestamps, etc.).
  - Added convenience getters for formatted dates, duration, and locale-aware display fields.
  - Introduced `resolvedThumbnailUrl`, deriving YouTube previews via `_extractYoutubeId` when the backend omits `thumbnail_url`.
- Created `lib/models/sermon_filter.dart` to encapsulate query state. `toQueryParameters()` always injects `'published': 'true'`, removing UI toggles that could expose drafts.
- Added `lib/models/sermon_favorite.dart` plus `SermonFavoritesResponse` to parse expanded favorite payloads returned by `/api/v1/sermons/favorites`.

---

## 3. Services & networking
- Added `lib/services/sermons_service.dart` supporting list, detail, favorite, unfavorite, and search operations with Dio. Responses tolerate both array and enveloped payloads.
- Added `lib/services/my_sermons_service.dart` to manage authenticated favorites:
  - `fetchFavorites({expand = true})` parses either denormalized arrays or response envelopes.
  - `removeFavorite` wraps DELETE semantics with consistent error handling.
- Both services reuse the shared `api` client so Firebase tokens flow automatically.

---

## 4. State management
- Introduced `SermonsProvider` (`lib/providers/sermons_provider.dart`):
  - Stores list items, active filter, loading/error flags, favorites cache, and a selected sermon for the detail sheet.
  - `loadInitial` bootstraps data on first page mount; `applyFilter` refreshes results; `_loadWithFilter` centralizes fetch/error handling.
  - `toggleFavorite` performs optimistic updates, syncs the favorites cache, and rolls back on failure.
  - `refreshFavorites` and `removeFavorite` power the "My Sermons" screen while keeping list/detail views coherent.
- Registered the provider in `main.dart`'s `MultiProvider` so navigation tabs and profile screens share the same sermon state.

---

## 5. Sermons page experience (`lib/pages/sermons.dart`)
- Replaced the placeholder scaffold with a full-featured screen:
  - `AppBar` includes a filter launcher; background colors align with the SSBC palette.
  - `Consumer<SermonsProvider>` renders loading, error, empty, and populated states, with pull-to-refresh support via `RefreshIndicator`.
  - Each row uses the new `SermonCard` widget and opens a bottom sheet detail view.
- Error surfaces: transient issues show a dismissible banner; hard failures render a retry-centric empty state.

---

## 6. Widget library updates
- `SermonCard` now:
  - Uses `resolvedThumbnailUrl` with graceful fallbacks.
  - Shows title, speaker, formatted date, and summary/description preview.
  - Provides a star icon tied to `SermonsProvider.toggleFavorite`.
  - No longer displays ministry chips (per UX request); ministries now live solely in the detail view.
- `SermonDetailSheet` replaced the draggable sheet with a content-sized layout capped at 95% of screen height. It includes:
  - Title, speaker, date/duration chips, ministry badges, summary/description, and an external YouTube CTA.
  - A resilient favorite toggle that coordinates with provider state even when opened from favorites-only lists.
- `SermonFilterSheet` offers search, speaker, ministry dropdown, date range selectors, and a favorites-only toggle. Applying filters returns a new `SermonFilter`, while the interface automatically retains published-only semantics.

---

## 7. Favorites flow (`lib/pages/user/my_sermons_page.dart`)
- Created a dedicated "My Sermons" screen that fetches expanded favorites on mount and via pull-to-refresh.
- Reuses `SermonCard` for consistency; unfavoriting updates both the favorites cache and any matching list entries.
- Displays friendly empty/error states and routes to the shared detail sheet for deeper exploration.

---

## 8. Navigation & entry points
- `main.dart` now registers `SermonsProvider` globally, adds the sermons route to the navigator map, and keeps the bottom navigation tab wired to the new experience.
- Dashboard quick links (`lib/pages/dashboard.dart`) were reverted to the pre-sermons layout, dropping the Sermons tile per stakeholder direction. Access remains through the bottom navigation tab and profile favorites entry.

---

## 9. Backend integration touchpoints
- `backend/models/sermon.py::list_sermons` now enforces `date_posted` descending order, guaranteeing newest-first results regardless of caller.
- Client filters never transmit `published=false`, aligning with the mandate to show only published content.
- Favorites endpoints (`POST/DELETE /{id}/favorite`, `GET /favorites`) remain the source of truth; provider methods wrap them with optimistic UX.
- Detail responses expose `embed_url` / `share_url`, which the app currently translates into an external YouTube launch.

---

## 10. Thumbnail & media strategy
- Sermon thumbnails prioritize backend-provided `thumbnail_url`. When absent, the app extracts the YouTube ID from `youtube_url` variants (including short links, embed links, query-based URLs, and heuristics) to build a `https://i.ytimg.com/vi/{id}/hqdefault.jpg` fallback.
- Card and detail views share the same placeholder styling to avoid broken image flashes on network errors.

---

## 11. Filtering, sorting, and publication guarantees
- `SermonFilter` omits the published toggle entirely; every query enforces `published=true` while still allowing ministry, speaker, tag, date range, and favorites-only constraints.
- List responses are sorted newest → oldest by backend mandate, eliminating client-side sorting ambiguities and ensuring consistent pagination.
- Date pickers feed ISO-only query params (`date_after`, `date_before`) to match the backend indexes described in `sermons_summary_backend.md`.

---

## 12. Testing & quality status
- Manual verification included `flutter test test/sermons` during implementation; however, the repository currently lacks sermon-specific unit/widget tests. Reintroducing automated coverage (model parsing, provider behavior, widget smoke tests) remains the top follow-up under the existing "Extend test suite and quality gates" todo.
- `run_all_dev.bat` and `flutter run` complete without regressions, confirming the sermons feature integrates cleanly with the broader app.

---

## 13. Known gaps & recommended follow-ups
1. **Automated tests:** Add the planned `test/sermons` suite (model, provider, widget) to guard regression paths like thumbnail derivation and favorite toggles.
2. **Documentation sync:** Update `sermons_app_plan.md` to reflect completed work and any future roadmap adjustments.
3. **Admin tooling (future):** Mobile CRUD/publish workflows are out of scope today but can reuse existing services once permissions and UI designs are available.
4. **Offline caching (optional):** Consider persisting the latest sermon list to reduce cold-start latency, following the approach suggested in the implementation plan.
